# Clockworkmind.com: A Development Blog

I decided to host this blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) for now. Might as well have it close to my projects.

The blog is based on GitHub's version of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The theme is [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com), by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

I'm typing this up on Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) right now, but I'll probably use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) as well. (Actually, what I'm noticing is that I need a spell checker.)

My personal computer is a MacBook Pro, but work is all Windows. [Getting Jeckyll to work properly on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) is interesting.
