title: How do I know I'm a developer?
---

I spend so much time figuring out new ways and tools to be more productive, I think it might cut into my productivity.

That's not surprising, though. I'm an inveterate game re-starter, spending days experimenting on setups before actually playing the game much. Madden franchise mode is like a drug as far as setting up modified (but realistic) teams, but I've played that first rainy preseason game in Madden 12 so many times I've come to dislike the Patriots even more. (Madden 12: The last one with real create-a-team. I miss that.) And don't get me started on all of the RPG characters along the way.

As you can imagine, a person who spends a lot of time setting up the perfect beginnings also has trouble with imperfect conclusions. Which is why it's good sometimes just to do something and throw it out there. It's fun to play the game as well.

Writing on blogs is that kind of thing. You can write and rewrite, but if you don't finish and publish, there isn't much of a point. So, I'm hoping this blog will be an outlet to encourage some imperfect work along the way.

Since I'm always learning new things, I'll keep track of new programming and development knowledge here, and I'll link over to some of my experiments when they make it to (GitHub)[https://github.com/shanethacker]. Unlike at work, I'm hoping for successes *and* failures here.

In the meantime, if you'd like to know more about me, take a quick trip over to (The Phantom City)[http://www.thephantomcity.com], my personal blog.

Thanks for coming along for the ride.
