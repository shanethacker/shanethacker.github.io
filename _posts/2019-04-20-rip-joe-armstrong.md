Sad news today. Joe Armstrong, co-creator of the [Erlang programming language](https://www.erlang.org/), passed away.

I never met him, but I read his writings in books, Twitter, and his blog, and he always struck me as a person who knew how to be an older programmer. He was constantly teaching people and learning new things, behaving with grace, dignity, and humor, always curious...this is the model I want to follow.

It's tempting to say the world got a little darker today, but instead we'll remember how Joe Armstrong's life made it a little brighter.
